# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
        ```
        Evaluation of Accessibility, Reproducibility, and Equity
        Accessibility:
        Color Differentiation: Similar shades of red for segments A and B make it difficult for color-blind individuals to distinguish between them.
        Numeric Labels: The absence of numeric data or percentages limits accessibility, especially for screen reader users.
        Reproducibility:
        Data Source: The chart does not provide a data source, making verifying or reproducing the results impossible.
        Incomplete Information: Without numeric labels or segment explanations, accurate reproduction is challenging.
        Equity:
        Context and Explanation: Lack of context for labels A, B, and C hinders understanding for all viewers, creating inequity.
        Visual Design: Poor color choices and lack of detailed labels disproportionately affect those with visual impairments or cognitive disabilities.

        ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?  
        ```
        Improvements for Accessibility, Reproducibility, and Equity
        Accessibility:
        Color Differentiation: Use distinctly different colors for each segment to ensure they are easily distinguishable by everyone, including those with color vision deficiencies.
        Numeric Labels: Include numeric data or percentages on each segment to provide precise information and improve accessibility for screen reader users.
        Reproducibility:
        Data Source: Clearly state the source of the data used in the chart to allow others to verify and reproduce the results.
        Complete Information: Provide a legend or additional text explaining what labels A, B, and C represent to ensure the chart can be accurately reproduced.
        Equity:
        Context and Explanation: Offer clear explanations or context for each segment to ensure all viewers understand the information being presented.
        Inclusive Design: Use a clean, consistent design with balanced colors and clear labeling to ensure the chart is easily interpretable by individuals with varying levels of visual and cognitive abilities.
        By addressing these aspects, the donut chart can be improved to be more accessible, reproducible, and equitable, ensuring it communicates information effectively to all viewers.

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses learning outcomes 2 and 3:  
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
