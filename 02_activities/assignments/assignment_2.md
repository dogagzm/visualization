# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
        Good Visualization Example: Donut Chart
        Visualization Title: "Market Share of Smartphone Operating Systems"
        Source: StatCounter GlobalStats Link
        Reason for Classification:
        Clarity: The distinct, contrasting colors make it easy to differentiate between segments. Clear labels with percentages help viewers quickly understand the data.
        Accuracy: The data is from a reputable source (StatCounter), ensuring reliability and accuracy.
        Relevance: The chart focuses on the main operating systems, presenting relevant and significant information without unnecessary details.
        Aesthetics: The clean design and effective use of colors and white space make the chart visually appealing and easy to read.
        Interactivity: The online version allows users to hover over segments for more detailed information, enhancing understanding and engagement.
        This visualization follows best practices in data visualization, emphasizing clarity, accuracy, and effective design as discussed by Edward Tufte and Stephen Few.
        Bad Visualization Example: Donut Chart
        Visualization Title: "Donut Chart Example"
        Source: User-uploaded Image
        Reason for Classification:
        Clarity: The similar shades of red for segments A and B cause confusion, making it hard to distinguish between them.
        Accuracy: The chart lacks numeric data or percentages, preventing accurate interpretation.
        Relevance: Labels A, B, and C are not explained, reducing the chart's informational value.
        Aesthetics: The poor use of similar colors and lack of detailed labeling make the chart visually ineffective.
        Interactivity: As a static image, it offers no interactivity, limiting user engagement and deeper understanding.
        This chart fails to meet key principles of good data visualization, such as clarity, accurate representation, and effective design, as highlighted by experts like Tufte and Few.

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
        Clarity: Use distinctly different colors for each segment to ensure they are easily distinguishable. Ensure that the colors contrast well to avoid confusion.
        Accuracy: Include numeric data or percentages on each segment. This addition will provide precise information and improve the viewer's ability to interpret the data accurately.
        Relevance: Provide context or explanations for what labels A, B, and C represent. A legend or additional text can clarify what each segment stands for, making the chart more informative.
        Aesthetics: Enhance the visual appeal by using a clean, consistent design. Avoid using colors that are too similar, and consider adding a title inside the central hole of the donut chart to make use of space effectively.
        Interactivity: If the chart is presented digitally, add interactive elements. Allow users to hover over or click on segments to see detailed information, such as exact values or additional context.
        Example of an Improved Donut Chart: Colors, Labels, Context, Design, Interactivity
         
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
